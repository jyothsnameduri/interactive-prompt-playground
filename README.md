## Features

- Create prompts for generating product descriptions
- Test different parameter combinations:
  - Temperature (0.0, 0.7, 1.2)
  - Max tokens (50, 150, 300)
  - Presence penalty (0.0, 1.5)
  - Frequency penalty (0.0, 1.5)
- Select between different AI models (GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4)
- Input custom system prompt and user prompt
- View results in a grid/table format
- Double-click on results to view full output in a dedicated window
- Add reflections on the generated outputs
- Save reflections to a file

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-prompt-playground.git
   cd interactive-prompt-playground
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python prompt_playground.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Enter a product name (e.g., iPhone, Tesla, running shoes)
2. Customize the system prompt and user prompt
3. Adjust parameters using the sliders
4. Click "Generate" for a single output or "Batch Generate" to test multiple parameter combinations
5. Review the results in the table
6. Double-click on any result to see the full text

## Reflection on Parameter Effects

The parameter settings dramatically influence the quality, style, and content of the generated product descriptions. Temperature has the most noticeable impact, with lower values (0.0) producing factual, concise, and predictable descriptions focused on technical specifications and core functionality. As temperature increases (0.7-1.2), the outputs become more creative, using persuasive language, emotional appeals, and varied vocabulary. At the highest temperature setting (1.2), especially when combined with high presence and frequency penalties, the text becomes highly enthusiastic, using superlatives, metaphors, and more engaging narrative structures.

Token length naturally affects the amount of detail included, with shorter limits (50) forcing the model to prioritize only the most essential information, while longer limits (300) allow for comprehensive descriptions with multiple paragraphs covering features, benefits, and use cases. The presence and frequency penalties, when increased, push the model to avoid repetition and explore more diverse language patterns, resulting in more varied sentence structures and vocabulary choices. This is particularly evident when comparing the straightforward, repetitive phrasing in the 0.0/0.0 penalty outputs versus the rich, diverse language in the 1.5/1.5 penalty outputs. Overall, finding the right parameter combination depends on the specific communication goals: lower temperature and penalties for factual product specifications, and higher values for persuasive marketing copy.
